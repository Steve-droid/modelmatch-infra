# Home server preparation — September 12, 2026

Target: `steve@192.168.1.93`, hostname `home-server`, Ubuntu Desktop 26.04.1.
Hardware: Ryzen 5 5600H (6 cores / 12 threads), 24 GB installed RAM.
Ubuntu uses the Samsung 512 GB SSD. Steve confirmed Windows was intentionally removed.
The Kingston SSD contains a separate LUKS partition and has not been changed.

SSH key login from Steve's Mac was verified. Steve subsequently enabled passwordless `sudo -n`; see [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md).

## Power settings

Already applied over SSH to Steve's desktop account:

- `org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-ac-type = 'nothing'`
- `org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-battery-type = 'nothing'`

Original values were both `suspend`. A backup is on the laptop at
`/home/steve/home-server-setup/power-settings-before.json`.

Steve ran `configure-power.sh` successfully with sudo. It ignores lid
closure on AC/battery/docked operation, disables logind's idle action, and masks
the sleep/suspend/hibernate targets. This also blocks intentional manual sleep;
normal shutdown and reboot remain available. It reloads logind without restarting
the desktop session. Original system state is saved under
`/var/backups/modicum-power` for reversal.

The script does not install Kubernetes or applications, change partitioning,
modify SSH permissions, or alter the firewall. Keep the laptop connected to
power; this cannot keep a machine running after its battery is exhausted.

Verified on September 12, 2026: Steve closed the lid and a new key-authenticated
SSH connection succeeded. The kernel reported `state: closed`, AC power was
connected, all five sleep targets were masked, and the lid configuration matched
the intended settings. The laptop remained awake (uptime: 40 minutes).

K3s foundation is now installed and verified; see [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md).
Application/data migration remains under E21. The historical setup below did not change AWS.

## Reversal

With administrator access, restore the prior logind drop-in if one was backed up;
otherwise remove only `/etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/90-modicum-home-server.conf`.
Consult `targets.before` before unmasking: unmask only targets that were not
already masked. Reload `systemd-logind.service`. Restore the two GNOME values
from `power-settings-before.json` in Steve's user session.
