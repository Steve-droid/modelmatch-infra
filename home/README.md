# Driftplain home Kubernetes migration

Started September 12, 2026. This implements **E21 — durable home hosting** in the
[active backlog](../../docs/planning/02-showcase-backlog.md), which must finish before P39.
Driftplain will stay online and be maintained; it has no showcase expiry date. **AWS remains production until verified
cutover and Steve's explicit teardown approval.** Steve approved the completed foundation
and workspace consolidation on September 12, 2026; subsequent slices retain their review gates.

## Current slice: private cluster foundation

Source: infra `ef638ceff176915c9c3280ba032e5fda02c4b685` (current origin/main), branch
`feature/home-k3s-bootstrap`, now in the canonical `modelmatch-infra/` directory after
workspace cleanup. The product repos are current; unrelated runtime data is preserved.

**Current administrator access:** after bootstrap, Steve enabled passwordless sudo with
`steve ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` in `/etc/sudoers.d/99-steve-nopasswd`.
He validated sudoers; Codex independently verified `sudo -n whoami` returns `root`
over a fresh strict-key SSH connection. Use `sudo -n` for authorized home-server work;
no password retrieval or interactive authentication is needed. The interactive commands
below describe the original bootstrap. Commit review, public cutover and AWS teardown
approval requirements remain in effect.

- Single-node K3s **v1.36.4+k3s1**, the September 12 stable channel. Matches the live
  EKS 1.36 minor; later chart/operator compatibility must be verified during deployment.
- Embedded etcd stores Kubernetes state and makes local snapshots twice daily (retain
  three). One member provides **no physical HA**. These snapshots do **not** back up PVCs.
- Bundled containerd, CoreDNS, metrics-server and local-path storage. Traefik and
  ServiceLB disabled; app ingress/ArgoCD belong to the next slice.
- Samsung root disk only; no partitioning, formatting, second-SSD use, or power changes.
- Existing host swap retained. Kubelet explicitly uses `failSwapOn: false` + `NoSwap`;
  reserve 2 GiB for the OS and 1 GiB for Kubernetes; cap container log rotation.
- UFW enabled with default deny incoming/routed, LAN SSH and scoped pod traffic/egress.
  No external API, kubelet, VXLAN, ingress or database ports are allowed. Enabling UFW
  also limits inbound desktop discovery/services; outbound desktop traffic remains allowed.
- API operations use the home-only kubeconfig. Existing Mac AWS context stays unchanged.

`bootstrap.sh` defaults to read-only `--check`. `--apply` requires interactive sudo,
rechecks host/filesystem/address and empty effective firewall, refuses existing cluster
paths, backs up UFW, installs checksummed upstream artifacts, loads network modules,
enables forwarding, excludes virtual interfaces from NetworkManager management, and
starts K3s. It never changes SSH authentication or creates sudo exemptions.
Downloads happen **unprivileged**; the root installer uses a verified root-owned copy.
Bootstrap is deliberately fresh-host-only: after installation use `verify.sh`, not a
second installation. On partial failure inspect the reported backup/state before retrying.
`finish-bootstrap.sh` completes readiness and user kubeconfig creation if installation
finished but node registration had not yet completed; it performs no install/restart.

## Run

Files are uploaded to `/home/steve/home-server-setup/k3s/`. On Ubuntu as steve:

```bash
bash /home/steve/home-server-setup/k3s/prepare.sh
bash /home/steve/home-server-setup/k3s/bootstrap.sh --check
```

Administrator step, run on the **Mac**, entering the password only in the terminal:

```bash
ssh -t steve@192.168.1.93 'sudo bash /home/steve/home-server-setup/k3s/bootstrap.sh --apply'
```

Then Codex runs the smoke as the normal SSH user:

```bash
bash /home/steve/home-server-setup/k3s/verify.sh
```

Do not overwrite a running shell script during an upload. If editing while a smoke
runs, execute a separate immutable copy and preserve its result until completion.

The smoke checks exact node/version, effective swap config and container swap limit,
CoreDNS, external DNS + HTTP egress, ClusterIP service routing, metrics and a PVC's
content after deleting/recreating its pod. It uses a digest-pinned BusyBox image,
restricted pods with resource limits, and a unique labelled namespace. Successful
tests delete only their own namespace/PVC; failures retain it for diagnosis.
This tests disposable local-path storage, not production backup/restore durability.

Home kubeconfig: `/home/steve/.kube/driftplain-home.yaml` (0600, admin credential,
context `driftplain-home`, loopback API). Do not print it or merge it into default config.
For eventual Mac access, securely copy it to a separate 0600 file and change only its
server to `https://127.0.0.1:16443`; use an SSH local forward bound to `127.0.0.1`.
Keep `--kubeconfig` and `--context` explicit. The copy needs renewal when certificates
are renewed; the root-managed source is authoritative.

## Active migration plan

[E21 / HM1–HM8](../../docs/planning/02-showcase-backlog.md) is the sole active migration
plan and decision record. It covers host recovery, off-machine backup/restore, the home
GitOps profile, sustainable external dependencies/public operation, maintained-service
wording, verified cutover and approved retirement of replaced AWS resources. P39 follows
only after E21 is accepted. AWS remains production today; no application/data cutover
was performed by this bootstrap. The service will remain online after the post.

## Inventory — September 12, 2026

- Home: Ubuntu Desktop 26.04.1, Linux 7.0.0-31, x86_64 Ryzen 5600H, 22 GiB usable RAM
  (~14 GiB available), 422 GiB root disk free; cgroup v2; `/swap.img` 8 GiB/unused.
  Ethernet eno1 `192.168.1.93/24`, DHCP via `192.168.1.1`. No existing runtimes/cluster.
  Root UUID `9ce972e8-f060-45fc-97fe-296664de6a7c`; Kingston LUKS SSD untouched.
- Privileged preflight: UFW **inactive**, despite its systemd unit being enabled/active;
  IPv4 filter/NAT and IPv6 filter policies ACCEPT, no rules. Modules available; no
  listener on cluster ports; IP forwarding initially 0. Original report remains on Ubuntu.
- AWS: explicit `saa` profile, account `957261948820`, `ap-south-1`, cluster `modelmatch`.
  Three Ready nodes on `v1.36.3-eks-cb19647`. All 14 ArgoCD apps Synced/Healthy;
  source revision `413b84b050d5b62b87324a9e6d9cbebc33ba1357`. FE and BE both **1.0.24**.
  `api.driftplain.dev/readyz` returns ready/db ok. App namespace is **app**, not modelmatch.
- Existing budget teardown is **armed**: `modelmatch-budget-killswitch` Active,
  `DRY_RUN=0`, with `modelmatch-platform-teardown` CodeBuild present. Budget reports
  $45.709 actual against $110; automatic teardown threshold is 90% ($99). This is an
  independent risk to the requested rollback window. Leave untouched in this slice;
  resolve with Steve before the threshold approaches, rather than promising AWS cannot
  be destroyed by the pre-existing automation.
- CNPG: two healthy instances, PostgreSQL image `16.10-system-trixie`, two 5 GiB gp3
  PVCs. Current chart uses reclaim Delete and has no backup policy. Home must override
  this explicitly; local-path capacity requests alone do not enforce disk quotas.
- Live read-only DB counts: users 9, projects 11, CI runs 209, findings 830, feedback 709,
  source documents 0, Jenkins connections 5, LLM calls 4. All five Jenkins connections
  have CI token hashes; zero have Jenkins-token refs or model-API-key refs.
  Schema `a4b5c6d7e8f9`.
  These counts are an inventory, **not a backup** or a full integrity comparison.
- Current seed flags are both **false**. The migrate PostSync hook is **unconditional**
  and its image still pins 1.0.22. Home chart must make restore/migration policy explicit
  before any sync; copying the AWS root would run that hook on the restored database.
- Actual backend `app/config.py`, `blob_store.py`, `secret_store.py` only implement
  in-memory blob/secret stores. S3/Secrets Manager adapters described in their docstrings
  are not implemented. ESO-managed app credentials are a separate, real AWS dependency.
  No source-document rows or stored Jenkins/BYOK references exist. The five CI token
  hashes must survive the restore unchanged. The in-memory adapters are still a product
  limitation for future uploads/credential writes, not missing migration payloads here.

## Verification record

Before installation: Bash syntax and ShellCheck 0.11.0 pass for the bootstrap/smoke scripts;
remote unprivileged checks pass; official binary and installer SHA256 match. A negative
checksum test exposed a relative-path issue with symlinked download directories; corrected
to use the explicit script-directory checksum file, then confirmed corrupted binaries fail
before host writes. Live installation exposed a systemd-ready/node-registration race;
the finish step now waits for node existence before waiting for Ready. Runtime results
are recorded separately in RESULTS.md.

## Recovery / removal

The installer saves original UFW files/rules and forwarding state in a root-only directory
under `/var/backups/driftplain-k3s.*`; its path is also saved in
`/var/backups/driftplain-k3s-last-backup`. No automatic rollback alters network state after
a partial failure. Inspect first; the files and error identify how far installation got.

To pause the empty cluster, use `sudo systemctl stop k3s` (not uninstall). Persistent files
remain, and boot enablement remains. Stopping K3s does not guarantee every container stops;
review the running state if maintenance requires all workloads quiescent.

**Do not run `k3s-uninstall.sh` after restoring data**: it deletes local cluster data,
including local-path volumes. Before any removal, verify off-machine backups and approve
the exact removal/reversal script. Restore only this slice's UFW/default files and drop-ins;
do not reset the firewall or touch the completed lid/power configuration.

## Workspace and planning update

The active epic is E21 in the umbrella backlog; its HM1–HM8 acceptance gates replace
the preliminary migration stages. Completing the migration includes sustainable
backups/monitoring/maintenance, accurate maintained-service wording, and verified public
operation before P39. Replaced AWS resources are retired only after approval; the application
itself is not retired. Completed power setup is documented in [POWER.md](POWER.md).
