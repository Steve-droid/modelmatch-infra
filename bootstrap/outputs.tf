# Cross-stack outputs: the platform stack (and later CI / gitops) read these via a
# `terraform_remote_state` data source pointed at this bootstrap state — ECR URLs/ARNs, the
# state-bucket name/ARN, the budget topic.
#
# NOTE: the platform `backend "s3"` block does NOT read these. A backend block accepts only
# literals (no variables, no remote_state), so bucket/key/region are hardcoded there and kept
# in sync across the two backend.tf files by hand (see modelmatch-infra/CLAUDE.md). These
# outputs feed the `terraform_remote_state` data source (which can take config) and `terraform
# output` for humans/scripts — not the backend block.
