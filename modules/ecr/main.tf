# IMPORT NOTE (P5): the three repos already exist (created during the smoke, they hold the
# live :1.0.0 images). This config is matched to the live settings (MUTABLE / scanOnPush=false
# / AES256) so `terraform import` followed by `plan` shows NO destroy/replace — only the new
# lifecycle policies (which the repos never had) plus benign default_tags additions.
